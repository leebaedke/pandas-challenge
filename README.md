I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me solve some of the coding. I also had a TA help me with a bit of code: Specifically removing some formating and reassigning from object to float.

I have copied the text of the .docx file here for your convenience.

Written Report

This is an analysis of high schools and students in a school district. I imported the data into Pandas, combined it, organized it, and made several calculations. With the results I was able to make certain conclusions based on the data.
-The largest schools, regardless of being a charter schools or a district school, had the worst overall percentage of passing at 58.3%.
-Charter schools had a much higher passing percentage than district schools. 90.4% of charters students passing. While only 53.7% of students at district schools passed.
- Cabrera High School, a charter school, had the highest passing percentage, and had the third least spending per student overall.
